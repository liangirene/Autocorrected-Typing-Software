# Autocorrected-Typing-Software
In this project, I created a program that accurately measures typing speed  while incorporating typing autocorrect functionality. Inspired by the popular typing game, Type Racer (https://play.typeracer.com/), I aimed to provide users with a similar experience while focusing on enhancing their typing skills.

By developing this program, users can engage in typing exercises to assess their speed and accuracy. The inclusion of autocorrect functionality aids in reducing errors and improving overall typing precision. This project serves as a platform for users to practice typing and monitor their progress over time.
